A mini chat app is a simplified version of a chat application, typically with a smaller feature set and less complexity compared to a full-featured chat app. A mini chat app typically allows users to send and receive text messages in real-time, and may also include basic features such as user authentication and message history. The main goal of a mini chat app is to provide a basic chat functionality without the need for a large amount of development resources.
